    <h2>What is MBTI?</h2>
    <p id = "mbti_description">
        The Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing 
        psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions.
        The test attempts to assign four categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving.
    </p>
    <h2> Why did we make this?</h2>
    <p> In order to find out one's MBTI, one needs to spend about 30 minutes. Rather than spending long time to get one's MBTI, we wanted
        to give the user a quick estimation of MBTI based on their last text message or social media post.
    </p>
    <h2> How do I use this?</h2>
    <p> In the input box, enter in at least 3 (or more!) text message that you last sent or your last social media post. It could even be a phrase
        that you use a lot. Then, we will give your top 5 possible MBTIs. Additionally, taking your top MBTI, we will also give 
        movie recommendations in which there are a lot of characters with the same MBTI as you. By having characters with the same MBTI as you,
        you will be able to relate to each other!
    </p>
